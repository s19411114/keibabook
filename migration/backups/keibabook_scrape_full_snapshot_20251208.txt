KeibaBookScraper.scrape() full implementation snapshot
===================================================

This file is a snapshot placeholder indicating that the full implementation of
`KeibaBookScraper.scrape()` that existed on 2025-12-08 was archived for
migration/inspection. The full function was large (~400 lines) and includes the
original orchestration, login checks, rate-limiting logic, fetch/parse/merge
steps, and debug output logic.

The original implementation remains available via commit history, and a
reference to the original file path is kept here:
  - src/scrapers/keibabook.py

Maintain the original code in git history for review and future archival if
needed. The repo now contains a simplified version in `src/scrapers/keibabook.py`
which delegates to helper functions for the common flows.
